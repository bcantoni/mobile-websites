# Mobile Website Directory Project

## About

This is the code which powers the mobile website directory I've been running at <http://cantoni.mobi> since 2002. I originally titled it "PDA Optimized Web Sites" and for a long time was the #1 Google search result for that funny sounding title. For a long time I actively accepted suggestions from visitors who helped me keep the links up to date. Recently there's been some interest in doing some more updates, so I'm moving everything up to GitHub to make it more accessible.

## Criteria

To be included on the list, a proposed website should:

1. Be broadly interesting. Narrow niches or very location specific usually would not qualify (e.g. Palm Beach Hotels).
2. Have an actual mobile site. Whether it's automatically detected or using a mobile-specific domain, the site should in fact be mobile-friendly (meaning works on small screens and be size effecient).

## Contributing

There are a couple ways to contribute new sites or suggest changes:

### Open an Issue

The simplest option (and only requires a GitHub account) is to [open an issue](https://github.com/bcantoni/mobile-websites/issues) here with all the details.

### Submit a Pull Request

If you're more familiar with GitHub development and the structure of the code here (see below), you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/bcantoni/mobile-websites/pulls) to change the data file directly.

## Structure

TBD - currently in progress of migrating to something easier to manage...
